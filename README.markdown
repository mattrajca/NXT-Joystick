NXT Joystick
============

NXT Joystick allows you to drive a NXT bot with iPhone. Since direct Bluetooth connections cannot be made from iPhone to the NXT brick, a server component is required. iPhone 4 or better is also required to run the client program as the gyroscope is used to track device attitude.

Usage
-----

1. Run the 'Server' program on your Mac and connect to a NXT brick with its left and right motors connected to ports B and C, respectively
2. Run the iPhone client and select your Mac in the device browser
3. Once a connection is established, the iPhone client will start sending device attitude data to your Mac
